# sudoku_game_and_solver
all the relevant code is in main.py.
this project shows my ability to self learn new APIs such as pygame, 
and the ability to take control over the logic behind the program,
which in this case includes 2d list and handeling with it, loops and complicated if statments, recursion algorithm.
in order to put a number in the board you click left mouse button on an empty place and then pressing a number.
you can erase a number from the board by clicking right mouse button,
and pressing the "s" button will activate the backtracking sudoku solver.
the project containts comments, i hope it helps to understand what the code means.
there is also a commented explanation about the backtracking recursion algorithm.
if you have any questions you can contact me at yuvalcrawcour@gmail.com
